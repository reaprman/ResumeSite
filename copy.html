                        In the hopes of improving my design and architect abilities in regards to configured and coding computer systems I decided to join Enablon's

                        to know being able to deliver to a client a solution that would fit their needs. This new team is full of experienced members who are willing to discuss
                        a wide range of highly technical implementation details. This openness between consultants allows for confidence that support is availabe even on complex tasks.
                        Allowing everyone to fully take ownership of their work and deliver a quality software product.

                        After winning and completed the Grow with Google Scholarship program offered by Google on Udacity I was offered the opportunity to take a full

                        experience in regards to taking a programming course fully online in an academic setting. There were many concepts and tools that were required to be learned
                        during the course of the program. This sharpened my skills in documentation reading and allowed me to make the best of my time in learning the core concepts of
                        the different programming techniques. The importance of a good development tool set and ones knowledge of that tool set for any project is one of my key takeaways
                        in this experience.

                        Being at Enablon taught me the importance of patience and working within a team as an individual. Being in a programming role while being directly

                        internship the initial concept was developed and scoped out was presented to the VP. After this the internship was extended
                        to develop a working test of the design. It was during this process that I realized the importance of a good design and framework
                        when starting any project. After six months the project culminated in a working automation example leveraging Golang server for back-end

                    Ryan Logan is an aspiring Web Developer who masquerades as a Software Services Consultant by day in Chicago, IL.
                    Technology as has been a very big influence in my life, ever since being introduced to computers around the age of 8.
                    Like all kids this started with a love for video games 🎮. As I grew older and gained access to the World Wide Web and starting seeing
                    what was available and what it could offer I knew that I wanted to have a job dealing with content creation on the internet. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, knowing what you want to do and actually fingering out how to accomplish that in an efficient manner is another story entirely. In pursuit of this goal
                    I decided to attend Northern Illinois University 🏫, where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in computer science. With so many avenues avaialable in programming, 
                    it was difficult for me to pick a job that would fit me. However, I ended up taking an internship my senior year for a company called Morey Corporation. There I worked with a lead 
                    designer in creating automation software for the company's equipment. This led me to be introduced to the Go programming language for backend server communication. 
                    This coupled with work in html, css and javascript lead the project to finish with a live webpage that would demo a sub-section of a full automation test. This was presented for the companies vice president.
                    <br><br>
                    This experience of using programming to create a useful piece of technology was the type of work experience that I was looking for. But as with all dreams they may need to be deferred
                    for a time before they can come to fruition. Like most adults the pressures of bills,aka student loans &#128516, lead me to my current company Enablon. Over the years I have always kept that
                    deferred plan in the back of my mind and coming into 2017 I decided to take action &#128170. This lead me to completing 4 training courses over the past 2 years, covering front-end and back-end
                    web development. I also applied for the Grow with Google Scholarship program entering into 2017 and was luckily accepted. After completion, this lead to me being offered an opportunity to complete Udacity's Mobile 
                    Web Specialist Nanodegree program, which I did in Nov 2018. Technology moves at a rapid pace and I enjoy the learning process and the feeling of self improvment that comes with new knowledge. This won't be 
                    the end of my self improvement journey. The culmination of this journey has been long and worthwhile, and at the end of the day that's all that matters.
