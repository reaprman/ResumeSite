                    Ryan Logan is an aspiring Web Developer who masquerades as a Software Services Consultant by day in Chicago, IL.
                    Technology as has been a very big influence in my life, ever since being introduced to computers around the age of 8.
                    Like all kids this started with a love for video games üéÆ. As I grew older and gained access to the World Wide Web and starting seeing
                    what was available and what it could offer I knew that I wanted to have a job dealing with content creation on the internet. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now, knowing what you want to do and actually fingering out how to accomplish that in an efficient manner is another story entirely. In pursuit of this goal
                    I decided to attend Northern Illinois University üè´, where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in computer science. With so many avenues avaialable in programming, 
                    it was difficult for me to pick a job that would fit me. However, I ended up taking an internship my senior year for a company called Morey Corporation. There I worked with a lead 
                    designer in creating automation software for the company's equipment. This led me to be introduced to the Go programming language for backend server communication. 
                    This coupled with work in html, css and javascript lead the project to finish with a live webpage that would demo a sub-section of a full automation test. This was presented for the companies vice president.
                    <br><br>
                    This experience of using programming to create a useful piece of technology was the type of work experience that I was looking for. But as with all dreams they may need to be deferred
                    for a time before they can come to fruition. Like most adults the pressures of bills,aka student loans &#128516, lead me to my current company Enablon. Over the years I have always kept that
                    deferred plan in the back of my mind and coming into 2017 I decided to take action &#128170. This lead me to completing 4 training courses over the past 2 years, covering front-end and back-end
                    web development. I also applied for the Grow with Google Scholarship program entering into 2017 and was luckily accepted. After completion, this lead to me being offered an opportunity to complete Udacity's Mobile 
                    Web Specialist Nanodegree program, which I did in Nov 2018. Technology moves at a rapid pace and I enjoy the learning process and the feeling of self improvment that comes with new knowledge. This won't be 
                    the end of my self improvement journey. The culmination of this journey has been long and worthwhile, and at the end of the day that's all that matters.
